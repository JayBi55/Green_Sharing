##  The Problem: 

Earth Day expressed a need for application that could help :
* Organize multi-partiesâ€™ interactions
* Optimize (by reducing waste)  the gleaning process in Canada


## The solution: Green Sharing
* Personalization of the user experience 


* Interactive map 


* Gamification with the Review/Score  feature


* Ability to prioritised  event (high/urgent, mid, low)
Carpooling capabilities between gleaners  

* Ludification of the platform  with a gallery page 

* OAuth Support (google/facebook)  (already in the DB) 

* Offline mode enabled


* Automatic matching on Gleaning Events/Gleaner/BankFood using ML model  



## Implementation:
**1.  FrontEnd** <br /> 
Read the readMe_frontE in the repository **front-end** for a better understanding of this part  <br /> 
**2.  BackEnd**  <br /> 
Read the readMe  in the repository **GreenSharing.API** for a better understanding of this part
 





## Other folders:

* In **Green_pics** we have all the pictures taken during the project.
* **Delivery:** All the documents that needs to be consulted by the client
